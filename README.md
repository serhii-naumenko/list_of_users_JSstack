It is necessary to implement the following functionality:

Displaying of: name, username, email, website for each user in the table.
Opening a modal window with more detailed information by clicking on a specific user, for example, street, city, zip code, etc.
Sorting users by any field, for example, by clicking on a column header.
Ability to add users.
Ability to remove users.

Requirements:
Do not use third-party libraries/frameworks when implementing this. The logic must be written in pure JavaScript.

Additionally it would be nice to implement:
Cross-browser compatibility (explicitly state which browsers are supported and to what level).
Support for mobile browsers (IOS and Android) with specialized mobile layout.
